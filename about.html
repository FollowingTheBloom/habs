Skaneateles Lake is the coldest of New York’s Finger Lakes, and at nearly 315-feet deep, it’s the third deepest of the 11 lakes that slice north to south like claw marks across western and central New York state. 

				<br /><br />

Cold and deep with a small watershed and a huge volume of water, Skaneateles was supposed to be immune from plagues like algal blooms, which can sicken humans, kill pets, and adversely affect everything from tourism to land values. 

				<br /><br />

But in the waning days of the blistering summer of 2017, a bloom spoiled the lake for the first time in recorded history and Skanateles went from being the exception to proving the rule: If a bloom can happen here, it can happen anywhere.
				
				<br /><br />
				
The bright green, tentacled algae blossomed again in 2018 and 2019, and the first bloom of 2020 was just recorded in mid-August, as instances of harmful blooms have skyrocketed throughout New York and the nation. 

				
				<br /><br />
				
Following the Bloom, conceived and created by journalist Ali Harford, explores the science, politics, and impact of these blooms on Skaneateles and the region that relies on it for its <a href="https://followingthebloom.github.io/habs/water.html" target="new"> drinking water. </a> She examines efforts to <a href="https://followingthebloom.github.io/habs/sla.html" target="new">fight the blooms,</a> delves into statewide data to show that HABS are getting worse <a href="https://followingthebloom.github.io/habs/maps.html" target="new">throughout the state,</a> reports on university scientists using <a href="https://followingthebloom.github.io/habs/su.html" target="new">sensors</a> to study the blooms, and puts a <a href="https://followingthebloom.github.io/habs/agriculture.html" target="new">spotlight on the debate</a> over who and what to blame for the blooms. 

				<br /><br />
				
Harford reported and wrote all the stories in the project, designed the project website, created the data visualizations, and shot many of the photos. She completed most of the work as a senior Magazine major at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School. The project was funded by a<a href="https://research.syr.edu/source/" target="new"> SOURCE </a>grant through the university's Office of Undergraduate Research and Creative Engagement.

				<br /><br />
				
				Newhouse<a href="https://newhouse.syr.edu/academics/degrees/bachelors/magazine-news-and-digital-journalism" target="new"> Magazine, News & Digital Journalism</a> professor Greg Munno helped edit the project and contributed photos and video. His work was supported by a CUSE grant that brought together a multidisciplinary team from SU’s engineering, architecture, and communications schools to study HABs on Skaneateles Lake.
